<h2> How To Play </h2>
  <p> Chess is a very complex game, but it's very easy to learn. To start off, let's discuss the pawn, the first line of defense between the enemy and your King. 
    Any individual pawn's first move can be a one or two space jump, but after that they can only move one space per move. They can also capture an enemy piece 
    by positioning themselves diagonally infront of the target, before diagonally attacking, moving into the captured piece's square, and moving one block diagonally.
    They can also perform something called 'En Passant', which is a way the game was designed so that a pawn can attack the enemy pawn that moved two spaces in front. 
    Next is the Bishop. These pieces can move and attack diagonally, and can become good snipers from a far distance, as their diagonal moves make them deadly. 
    They're not limited by the number of diagonal squares they can move per turn, but at the same time, they're limited by their fixed movability. Rooks are the opposite of Bishops.
    They can attack vertically and horizontally. They're extremly powerful if used correctly. Knights are pieces that move in a small L shape pattern, which the ability to leap
    through lines. Any piece in general can become powerful, but a very well known figure is the Queen. The Queen's movement and attacks are of a Bishop and Rook combined, giving
    it immense power. And finally the King, the piece who's fate determines the game. If the King is pinned down by an enemy piece and has no legal moves, it is in what's called
    checkmate, and then game is officially over. Kings and Rooks can 'Castle', meaning that they can switch places, however if say an enemy bishop is targeting the spaces that
    would've been used for a castle, the move cannot be performed.
<h2> Openings </h2>
  <p> There are various ways to open, but for starters, let's start with King's Pawn Opening, which consists of moving the pawn in front of the King by two squares. 
    This opens up to many possibilities, as already off the bat the Queen and Bishop can be deployed. While taking out the Queen early might not work against powerful opponents,
    if you know how to use the Queen and Bishop combo, it can end games rather quickly, or at the very least put your opponent at a disadvantage. Knights might also be used to 
    protect and attack the pawns in the center, given that controlling the four middle squares can become very powerful. 
  <p> The sister of this opening is known as the Queen's Pawn Opening. It's an interesting move, as it both opens a bishop to move, but also exposes your king in the process. However
    if you're a good player, you can surely use this opening to your advantage. Apart from some other moves, like bringing your knights out first or bringing up a different pawn other
    than those in front of the King and Queen, the opening moves have some limitation. But from there, the game can go anywhere, and be in anyone's favor. It all depends on how you
    and your opponent play. But at some point, the end must come.
<h2> Endgames </h2>
  <p> At the very end of the game, it all comes down to something called 'Checkmate'. A regular 'check' is when a King is being attacked by a piece. A 'checkmate' though is when
    the King is unable to escape, and thus the game ends. Usually these are by 'assisted' checks, where a piece, usually the Queen, is directly attacking the King, and even though
    the King can simply capture the Queen, with another piece like the Bishop protecting the Queen, the King is in checkmate, as long as he cannot move anywhere else and if there's no 
    other piece to capture the King. Usually, castling might end up being a mistake down the road, as say if a Rook attacked the King when he's behind three pawns, and there's no 
    other piece to intercept the attacking Rook, the King is in checkmate as he has no viable moves.
  <p> Chess is complicated, yes, but it can end up being fun. So try attemping some games for yourself, and perhaps it might end up being your new hobby.
